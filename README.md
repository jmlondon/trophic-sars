# Trophic Ecology of Seals & MarMam Stock Assessment Reports

## A Space and a Place

This GitHub repository is a place and space for discussion and collaboration 
among the AFSC Openscapes 2022 teams focussed on the 
**Trophic Roles of Ice Seals** and **Marine Mammal Stock Assessment Reports** --- but ALL are welcome!

Josh London (@jmlondon) is hosting this space as an Openscapes mentor. But, he relinquishes 
all ownership and control for the group to use and evolve this as needed. Since Josh has 
only limited experience using GitHub in the browser to create content, and, in the spirit 
of *community learning*, he's going to only use the web interface for this repository. 
So, we'll learn together!

## Weekly Quick Takes from Josh

Josh will do his best to participate in each of your Seaside Chats and support you along
as you develop your trailheads and pathways. Josh will also be participating in mentor
calls with Julie (@jules32), Emily (@EmilyMarkowitz-NOAA), and Megsie (@MargaretSiple-NOAA). 
Because of that, he'll have some unique perspective and will do his best to share a few 
Quick Takes from each week that might be relevant for this group.

## Ideas for Issue Discussions

Github Issues are an especially useful way to have discussions and share ideas that
- don't get lost in the river of email
- are retained when someone leaves the group
- are inclusive because new members can see past discussions

After the first co-hort call and initial 1:1 chats, here are a few ideas for issues
this group might want to start. @jmlondon will create the first item in the list as an
issue. But, for the rest, we'll rely on you to create those as issues

1. MML Github organization structures. Do we need orgs? 
2. Collaboration Tools & Workflows. What works? What doesn't?
3. ...
