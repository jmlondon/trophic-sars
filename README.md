# Trophic Ecology of Seals & Marine Mammal Stock Assessment Reports

This README is a living document and will change as the repository changes

## A Space and a Place

This GitHub repository is a place and space for discussion and collaboration 
among the AFSC Openscapes 2022 teams focussed on the 
**Trophic Roles of Ice Seals** and **Marine Mammal Stock Assessment Reports** --- but ALL are welcome!

Josh London ([@jmlondon](https://github.com/jmlondon)) is hosting this space as an Openscapes mentor. But, he relinquishes 
all ownership and control for the group to use and evolve this as needed. Since Josh has 
only limited experience using GitHub in the browser to create content, and, in the spirit 
of *community learning*, he's going to only use the web interface for this repository. 
So, we'll learn together!

## Collaborators

- Josh London / @jmlondon
- Brian Fadely / @BFadely

## Weekly Quick Takes from Josh

Josh will do his best to participate in each of your Seaside Chats and support you along
as you develop your trailheads and pathways. Josh will also be participating in mentor
calls with Julie ([@jules32](https://github.com/jules32)), 
Emily ([@EmilyMarkowitz-NOAA](https://github.com/EmilyMarkowitz-NOAA)), 
and Megsie ([@MargaretSiple-NOAA](https://github.com/MargaretSiple-NOAA)). 

## Ideas for Issue Discussions

Github Issues are an especially useful way to have discussions and share ideas that
- don't get lost in the river of email
- are retained when someone leaves the group
- are inclusive because new members can see past discussions

After the first co-hort call and initial 1:1 chats, here are a few ideas for issues
this group might want to start. @jmlondon will create the first item in the list as an
issue. But, for the rest, we'll rely on you to create those as issues

1. [Welcome to the Repo - What's your fav marine mammal? fish?](https://github.com/jmlondon/trophic-sars/issues/1)
2. Github organization structures. Do we need orgs?
3. Collaboration Tools & Workflows. What works? What doesn't?
4. ...

## Getting Started Editing Content on GitHub

### Task #1: Comment on an Issue
Use the first issue (`Welcome to the Repo ...`) to a make comment and let us know what your favorite
marine mammal 🦭 🐳 🐋 🐻‍❄️ 🐬 and fish 🐠 🐡 🐟 🦈 are, and why ! Then, for an advanced challenge,
do an internet search for `how to add an image to a github commit` and see if you can edit your
commit to include an image of your favorite

### Task #2: Edit this README.md
As a collaborator on this repository, you have the ability to edit content directly.

Here's how:

1. 📝 find the pencil icon in the upper right corner and click on it

2. 📜 make edits using the markdown language (go [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)) for a cheat sheet.
    For your first edit, find the section under `Collaborators` and your name and github username to the list

4. 🏹 when you are done with your edits and are ready to 'save' them, move your cursor to the
'Commit changes' section at the bottom of the page and type a short, meaningful commit message 
that describes the change you made to the file.

change to the `main` branch. All you have to do is press the green button ▶️ 🟩
